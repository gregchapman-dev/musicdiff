Changes since 3.0.0:

Feature-level changes:
    - Move lyrics diff from GeneralNotesOnly detail level to AllObjects detail level.
    - Compare GeneralNote offsets (visually, this is horizontal position in measure).
    - compare tuplet_info (num and numBase, num format/visibility, bracket visibility),
        not just tuplet (start/continue/stop).  This is technically a bugfix, but tuplet
        comparisons were pretty much not working at all, so I'm calling it a new feature.
    - Add py.typed, so clients can do mypy against musicdiff APIs.

Bugfixes:
    Metadata:
        - Contributor might not have any names.  Deal with it.
        - skip more metadata keys (that are specific to a particular file, so shouldn't
            be compared against another file): 'EMD', 'EST', 'VTS', 'RLN', 'PUB'.
        - html-unescape during annotation of metadata items.
    Style:
        - Ignore some style stuff we don't care about (e.g. absX/absY).
        - Ignore fontSize, and regularize how 'bold' is represented.
    Lyrics:
        - Don't annotate lyric style if it is empty (hasStyleInformation could still be True).
        - Consider lyric.syllabic == None and 'single' to be the same.
        - Better comparison of lyrics, treat style.absoluteY as placement fallback when
            placement is None.
        - For lyrics, ignore placement=='below' and justify=='left', as equivalent to not
            specifying.
        - Ignore empty lyrics.
    MetronomeMarks:
        - Ignore playback-only MetronomeMarks (they're not marked invisible, but they are
            not printed).
        - Treat MetronomeMark with explicit number and no explicit text the same as one with no
            explicit number and explicit text saying "x = NNN" (where x is a SMUFL note code
            followed by 1-4 SMUFL dots).  They are printed identically, so they are the same.
    Barlines:
        - no specified barline is the same as normal barline (at start and end of measure,
            that is).
        - ignore invisible ('none') barlines.
    Other fixes:
        - Fix crash when diff is visualized between note with accidental and unpitched note/rest
        - Ignore redundant system and page breaks
        - Grace vs Appoggiatura is more complex (in music21) than I thought.
        - Skip over non-realized ChordSymbols (realized ChordSymbols get treated as Chords)
        - Skip over StaffGroup that contains all the staves and has neither barTogether nor
            symbol.  Some file formats have one (MEI), and some file formats imply/don't need
            it (MusicXML).
