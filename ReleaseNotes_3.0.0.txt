Changes since 2.0.1:
    - Require music21 v9 (for several features/fixes) and converter21 v3
        (for improved Humdrum and MEI import)
    - Remove all checks for music21 features (they're all there in v9)
    - compare Mordent/Trill/Turn better, to include ornament accidentals
        (newly supported in music21 v9)
    - Compare metadata if requested (e.g. AllObjectsAndMetadata)
    - compare StaffLayout.staffLines and StaffLayout.staffSize
    - support tuplet.type = 'startStop'
    - fix tie annotation
    - finish tremolo annotation:
        notice fingered tremolos (TremoloSpanner)
        annotate tremolos as 'bTrem' (Tremolo, a.k.a. bowed tremolo, a.k.a. one note tremolo)
            vs. 'fTrem' (TremoloSpanner, a.k.a. fingered tremolo, a.k.a. two note tremolo)
    - compare rest positioning
    - better comparison of RepeatBrackets (support .overrideDisplay)
    - compare placement (above/below) of articulations and expressions (AllObjectsWithStyle)
    - support comparison of StaffGroups as part of AllObjects.
        StaffGroup bracket shape is relegated to AllObjectsWithStyle.
    - compare (and fill and transpose) Ottavas, maintaining accidental display status
        (newly possible in music21 v9)
    - compare delayed turns (new in music21 v9)
    - ignore redundant clefs during comparison
    - compare tuplet number/bracket visibility and format (and placement if diffing WithStyle)
