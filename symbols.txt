First a glossary of terms:
	AnnNote is a musicdiff-annotated note/rest/chord (by default, there are no
	    chords, only the notes within them)
	AnnVoice is a musicdiff-annotated voice (by default, there are no AnnVoices,
	    only the AnnNotes within them)
	AnnLyric is a musicdiff-annotated lyric syllable
	AnnExtra is a musicdiff-annotated musical object such as dynamic, text, clef,
	    keysig, timesig, metronome mark, etc
	AnnMeasure is a musicdiff-annotated measure
	AnnPart is a musicdiff-annotated staff
	AnnStaffGroup is a musicdiff-annotated staff group (as denoted by
	    braces/brackets/etc to the left of the score)
	AnnMetadataItem is a musicdiff-annotated metadata item, such as composer,
	    date of composition, etc
	AnnScore is a musicdiff-annotated score

AnnNote symbol count (rest, note, chord):
    (If Voicing is not specified explicitly on the command line, there are no
        chords, only the individual notes from the chords)

    For each note (1 rest, 1 note, or N notes in a chord):
        1 symbol for the pitch (even if unpitched)
        1 symbol if there is an accidental (even a triple flat is just 1 symbol)
        1 symbol if a tie starts on the note (we don't count tie stops)

    1 symbol for note head type: quarter, half, whole, breve etc
    1 symbol for each dot (e.g. double-dotted quarter note gets 2 symbols for dots)
    1 symbol for each flag or beam
    1 symbol for each enclosing tuplet
    1 symbol for each enclosing tuplet's style (is it visible? bracketed?)
    # (note head type + dots + flags/beams + tuplets implies visual duration)
    1 symbol for each articulation (staccato, tenuto, etc)
    1 symbol for each expression (mordent, trill, etc) (in future add 1 for
        ornament accidental?)
    1 symbol if a grace note
        1 symbol if that grace note has a slash
    1 symbol if there is abnormal note head shape (diamond, etc)
    1 symbol if there is abnormal note head fill
    1 symbol if there are parentheses around note head
    1 symbol if stem direction is specified
    1 symbol if there is a space (hidden rest) before the note
    1 symbol for all specified style info (e.g. color, size, etc) (in future
        might compare individual style entries)

AnnNote diff symbolic edit count:
    for each note (1 rest, 1 note, or N notes in a chord):
        pitch (line/space position) diff: If Voicing is not explicitly specified
            on the command line, we only compare notes that have the
            same line/space (vertical position) and offset (horizontal position).
            Any notes with no same-position note to compare against are deleted
            or added (with symbolic edit cost == note symbol count). If Voicing
            _is_ explicitly specified on the command line, a pitch diff is 2
            symbols (delete then add).
        accidental diff: 1 per accidental added or deleted
        tie start diff: 1 (add or delete the tie)
    note head type (quarter/half/whole/breve/etc) diff: 2 (delete then add)
    dots diff: 1 for each dot added or deleted
    grace type diff (acc vs unacc vs not grace): 2 (delete then add)
    grace slash diff: 1
    beams/flags diff: Levenshtein distance between lists of beams/flags
    tuplet diff: 1 for difference in tuplet actual count/normal count + 1 for difference in
        visibility, bracketing, etc.  If there is more than one (nested) tuplet, instead of
        1 + 1, use Levenshtein distance between lists of tuplets (actual/normal) + Levenshtein
        distance between lists of tuplets (visibility/bracket).
    articulation diff: Levenshtein distance between lists of articulations
    expression diff: Levenshtein distance between lists of expressions
    note shape diff (diamond, etc): 2 (delete then add)
    note head fill diff (beyond the usual quarter vs half): 1 (delete then add)
    note head parentheses diff: 1 (delete or add)
    "space before" diff: 1 (representing a horizontal shift of the note)
    note stem direction diff: 1 if adding or deleting stem, 2 if changing stem
        direction
    note style diff (e.g. color, size, etc): 1
