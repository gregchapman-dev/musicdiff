First a glossary of terms:
	AnnNote is a musicdiff-annotated note/rest/chord (by default, there are no chords, only the notes within them)
	AnnVoice is a musicdiff-annotated voice (by default, there are no AnnVoices, only the AnnNotes within them)
	AnnLyric is a musicidff-annotated lyric syllable
	AnnExtra is a musicdiff-annotated musical object such as dynamic, text, clef, keysig, timesig, metronome mark, etc
	AnnMeasure is a musicdiff-annotated measure
	AnnPart is a musicdiff-annotated staff
	AnnStaffGroup is a musicdiff-annotated staff group (as denoted by braces/brackets/etc to the left of the score)
	AnnMetadataItem is a musicdiff-annotated metadata item, such as composer, date of composition, etc
	AnnScore is a musicdiff-annotated score

AnnNote symbol count (rest, note, chord):
    (If Voicing is not specified explicitly on the command line, there are no chords,
    only the individual notes from the chords)

    For each note (1 rest, 1 note, or N notes in a chord):
        1 symbol for the pitch (even if unpitched)
        1 symbol if there is an accidental (even a triple flat is just 1 symbol)
        1 symbol if a tie starts on the note (we don't count tie stops)

    1 symbol for note head type: quarter, half, whole, breve etc
    1 symbol for each dot (e.g. double-dotted quarter note gets 2 symbols for dots)
    1 symbol for each flag or beam
    1 symbol for each enclosing tuplet
    1 symbol for each enclosing tuplet's style (is it visible? bracketed?)
    # note head type + dots + flags/beams + tuplets implies duration
    1 symbol for each articulation (staccato, tenuto, etc)
    1 symbol for each expression (mordent, trill, etc) (*** someday add 1 for ornament accidental? ***)
    1 symbol if a grace note
        1 symbol if that grace note has a slash
    1 symbol if there is abnormal note head shape (diamond, etc)
    1 symbol if there is abnormal note head fill
    1 symbol if there are parentheses around note head
    1 symbol if stem direction is specified
    1 symbol if there is a space (hidden rest) before the note
    1 symbol for all specified style info (e.g. color, size, etc) (in future might count entries)

        1 + 1, use Levenshtein distance between lists of tuplets (actual/normal) + Levenshtein
        distance between lists of tuplets (visibility/bracket).
    articulation diff: Levenshtein distance between lists of articulations
    expression diff: Levenshtein distance between lists of expressions
