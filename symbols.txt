First a glossary of terms:
	AnnNote is a musicdiff-annotated note/rest/chord (by default, there are no chords, only the notes within them)
	AnnVoice is a musicdiff-annotated voice (by default, there are no AnnVoices, only the AnnNotes within them)
	AnnLyric is a musicidff-annotated lyric syllable
	AnnExtra is a musicdiff-annotated musical object such as dynamic, text, clef, keysig, timesig, metronome mark, etc
	AnnMeasure is a musicdiff-annotated measure
	AnnPart is a musicdiff-annotated staff
	AnnStaffGroup is a musicdiff-annotated staff group (as denoted by braces/brackets/etc to the left of the score)
	AnnMetadataItem is a musicdiff-annotated metadata item, such as composer, date of composition, etc
	AnnScore is a musicdiff-annotated score

AnnNote symbol count (rest, note, chord):
    (If Voicing is not specified explicitly on the command line, there are no chords,
    only the individual notes from the chords)

    For each note (1 rest, 1 note, or N notes in a chord):
        1 symbol for the pitch (even if unpitched)
        1 symbol if there is an accidental (even a triple flat is just 1 symbol)
        1 symbol if a tie starts on the note (we don't count tie stops)

    1 symbol for note head type: quarter, half, whole, breve etc
    1 symbol for each dot (e.g. double-dotted quarter note gets 2 symbols for dots)
    1 symbol for each flag or beam
    1 symbol for each enclosing tuplet
    1 symbol for each enclosing tuplet's style (is it visible? bracketed?)
    # note head type + dots + flags/beams + tuplets implies duration
    1 symbol for each articulation (staccato, tenuto, etc)
    1 symbol for each expression (mordent, trill, etc) (*** someday add 1 for ornament accidental? ***)
    1 symbol if a grace note
        1 symbol if that grace note has a slash
    1 symbol if there is abnormal note head shape (diamond, etc)
    1 symbol if there is abnormal note head fill
    1 symbol if there are parentheses around note head
    1 symbol if stem direction is specified
    1 symbol if there is a space (hidden rest) before the note
    1 symbol for all specified style info (e.g. color, size, etc) (in future might count entries)

AnnNote diff symbol error count:
    for each note (1 rest, 1 note, or N notes in a chord):
        pitch diff: 1
        accidental diff: 1
        tie start diff: 1
    note head type (quarter/half/whole/breve/etc) diff: 1
    dots diff: 1 for each dot added or deleted
    grace type diff (acc vs unacc vs not grace): 1
    grace slash diff: 1
    beams/flags diff: Levenshtein distance between lists of beams/flags
    tuplet diff: 1 for difference in tuplet actual count/normal count + 1 for difference in
        visibility, bracketing, etc.  If there is more than one (nested) tuplet, instead of
        1 + 1, use Levenshtein distance between lists of tuplets (actual/normal) + Levenshtein
        distance between lists of tuplets (visibility/bracket).
    articulation diff: Levenshtein distance between lists of articulations
    expression diff: Levenshtein distance between lists of expressions
    note shape diff (diamond, etc): 1
    note head fill diff (beyond the usual quarter vs half): 1
    note head parentheses diff: 1
    "space before" diff: 1
    note stem direction diff: 1
    note style diff (e.g. color, size, etc): 1

-------------------------------------------------------------------

AnnExtra symbol count (dynamic, text, clef, keysig, timesig, metronome mark, etc):
    len(string) symbols for the extra itself
    1 symbol if styled (text style, color, etc)
    1 symbol for offset (horizontal position in measure)
    1 symbol for duration (horizontal length of, say, a crescendo wedge)

AnnExtra diff symbol error count:
    name/string diff: Levenshtein distance between strings
    offset diff: 1
    duration diff: 1
    style diff: 1

-------------------------------------------------------------------

AnnLyric symbol count (a single word or syllable):
    len(text) symbols for word/syllable (including any implied hyphens, etc)
    1 symbol for offset (horizontal position in measure)
    1 symbol if there is a verse number
    1 symbol if there is a verse identifier (that is not the verse number)
    1 symbol if styled (text style, color, etc)

AnnLyric diff symbol error count:
    text diff: Levenshtein distance between strings
    verse number diff: 1
    verse identifier diff: 1
    offset diff: 1
    style diff: 1

-------------------------------------------------------------------

AnnVoice symbol count (if Voicing is not explicitly specified on the command line,
    there are no AnnVoices):
    Sum of the symbols in all the AnnNotes in the AnnVoice

AnnVoice diff symbol error count:
    Sum of the symbol errors due to the AnnNotes in the AnnVoice
    If a voice is deleted or added, the symbol error count is the AnnVoice symbol count.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

AnnMeasure symbol count:
    if Voicing specified explicitly:
        Sum of symbol count for all AnnVoices, AnnExtras, and AnnLyrics in the AnnMeasure
    Normally:
        Sum of symbol count for all AnnNotes, AnnExtras, and AnnLyrics in the AnnMeasure

AnnMeasure diff symbol error count:
    Sum of the symbol errors for all objects in the AnnMeasure.
    If Voicing specified explicitly:
        If an entire AnnVoice is deleted or added, the symbol error count is incremented
            by that AnnVoice's symbol count.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

AnnPart symbol count:
    Sum of symbol count for all AnnMeasures in the AnnPart

AnnPart diff symbol error count:
    Sum of the symbol errors for all AnnMeasures in the AnnPart.
    If an entire AnnMeasure is deleted or added, the symbol error count is incremented
        by the AnnMeasure symbol count.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

AnnStaffGroup symbol count:
    len(name) symbols for staff group name (e.g. instrument name)
    1 symbol for staff group abbreviation
    1 symbol for staff group symbol shape (curly brace, bracket, line, etc)
    1 symbol for staff group barline type (bar together, don't bar together, Mensurstrich)
    1 symbol for the lowest staff index the staff group encloses (i.e. vertical position)
    1 symbol for the highest staff index the staff group encloses (i.e. vertical height)

AnnStaffGroup diff symbol error count:
    name diff: Levenshtein distance between names
    abbreviation diff: 1
    symbol diff: 1
    barline type diff: 1
    staff list diff: 1 for lowest staff index diff, 1 for highest staff index diff

-------------------------------------------------------------------

AnnMetadataItem symbol count (e.g. composer name, date composed, etc):
    len(key) + len(value) symbols for the item

AnnMetadataItem diff symbol error count:
    key difference: Levenshtein distance between key strings
    value difference: Levenshtein distance between value strings

-------------------------------------------------------------------

AnnScore symbol count:
    Sum of symbol counts for all AnnParts, AnnStaffGroups, and AnnMetadataItems in the AnnScore.

AnnScore diff symbol error count:
    Sum of symbol errors in all AnnParts, AnnStaffGroups, and AnnMetadataItems in the AnnScore
    If an entire AnnPart is added or deleted, the symbol error count is incremented
        by the AnnPart symbol count.
