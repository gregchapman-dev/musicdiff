# musicdiff
A Python3 package (and command-line tool) for computing and visualizing (or describing) the notation differences between two music scores.

musicdiff is focused on visible notation differences, not only on audible musical differences.  For example, two tied eighth notes are considered different from a single quarter note.  And two beamed 16th notes are considered different from two unbeamed 16th notes. This makes musicdiff particularly useful for assessing the results of Optical Music Recognition software.

musicdiff is derived from: [music-score-diff](https://github.com/fosfrancesco/music-score-diff.git)
    by [Francesco Foscarin](https://github.com/fosfrancesco).

## Setup
Depends on [music21](https://pypi.org/project/music21) (version 9.1+),  [numpy](https://pypi.org/project/numpy), and [converter21](https://pypi.org/project/converter21) (version 3.2+). You also will need to configure music21 (instructions [here](https://web.mit.edu/music21/doc/usersGuide/usersGuide_01_installing.html)) to display a musical score (e.g. with MuseScore).  Requires Python 3.10+.

## Usage
On the command line:

    python3 -m musicdiff -i decoratednotesandrests lyrics style -x beams -- file1.musicxml file2.krn

    arguments:
      -i/--include  one or more named details to include in comparison (the default is allobjects,
                    a.k.a. decoratednotesandrests and otherobjects). Can be decoratednotesandrests,
                    otherobjects, allobjects, or any combination of those and/or the following:
                    notesandrests; the aforementioned note decorations: beams, tremolos, ornaments,
                    articulations, ties, slurs; the other objects: signatures, directions,
                    barlines, staffdetails, chordsymbols, ottavas, arpeggios, and lyrics; and
                    a final few details that are not found in allobjects: style, metadata, and
                    voicing.  voicing compares how notes are included in voices and chords (by
                    default this is ignored).
      -x/--exclude  one or more named details to exclude from comparison.  Can be any of the
                    named details accepted by -i/--include.
      -o/--output   one or both of two output formats: text (or t) or visual (or v); the default
                    is visual). visual (or v) requests production of marked-up score PDFs; text
                    (or t) requests production of diff-like text output.

      file1         first music score file to compare (any format music21 or converter21 can parse)
      file2         second music score file to compare (any format music21 or converter21 can parse)

The source for that command-line tool, which calls musicdiff's high-level diff() API, can be seen [here](musicdiff/__main__.py).  You can use it as example code for adding musicdiff capabilities to your own code.  See the documentation [here](https://gregchapman-dev.github.io/musicdiff) to find out how to customize diff()'s behavior beyond what the command line tool does.

A google colab notebook is available [here](examples/musicdiff_demo.ipynb).

If you are interested in calling lower-level musicdiff APIs to do more complicated things than just visualization in PDFs or diff-like text output, the source for musicdiff's high-level diff() API (found [here](musicdiff/__init__.py)) is good example code to read.  Note particularly how diff() calls converter21.register() to register converter21's Humdrum and MEI parsers for use by music21.  If you call lower-level APIs than diff(), you will need to do this yourself.
