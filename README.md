# musicdiff
A Python3 package for computing and visualizing the differences between two music scores.

musicdiff is derived from: [music-score-diff](https://github.com/fosfrancesco/music-score-diff.git)
    by [Francesco Foscarin](https://github.com/fosfrancesco).

## Setup
Depends on music21 and numpy. You also will need to configure music21 to display a musical score (e.g. with MuseScore).

## Usage
An example music file comparison tool based on musicdiff's high-level API musicdiff.diff() is available in [comparescores.py](comparescores.py).  You can use it directly, or as example code for adding musicdiff capabilities to your own code.  

A google colab notebook is also available [here](examples/musicdiff_demo.ipynb).

The source for musicdiff.diff() (found [here](musicdiff/__init__.py)) is good example code to read if you want to call the lower-level musicdiff APIs to get the list of diffs and then do interesting things with that list.
