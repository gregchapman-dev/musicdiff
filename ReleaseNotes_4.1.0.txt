Changes since 4.0.0:
    Add new output option that prints JSON containing the symbolic error rate (SER =
        numSymbolErrors / numSymbolsInGroundTruth) to stdout (the JSON actually
        contains all three numbers).  Ground truth is assumed to be the second file.
        If numSymbolsInGroundTruth == 0, SER will be numSymbolErrors, to avoid divide
        by zero.
    Add new API Visualization.get_ser_output() that returns a dict containing the
        symbolic error rate.
    In support of SER, notation_sizes (a.k.a. symbol counts) and diff costs (a.k.a.
        symbolic error counts) have been reviewed and updated:
        AnnNote.notation_size(): add 1 symbol for slash on grace note
        AnnExtra.notation_size(): 1 symbol for the text, add 1 symbol if there is any
            style specified
        AnnExtra diff error count: text diff is 1 symbol error, offset diff is 1 symbol
            error, duration diff is 1 symbol error, style diff is 1 symbol error
        AnnLyric.notation_size(): use len(text) as symbol count instead of 1;
            add 1 symbol if there's a verse number;
            add 1 symbol if there's a verse identifier different from the number;
            add 1 symbol if styled
        AnnLyric diff cost: text diff symbol error count is the Levenshtein distance,
            verse number diff is 1 symbol error,  verse identifier diff is 1 symbol
            error, offset diff is 1 symbol error, style diff is 1 symbol error
        AnnMeasure.notation_size(): not just notes' symbols and extras' symbols, add in
            the lyrics' symbols
        AnnScore.notation_size(): not just parts' symbols, add in staff_groups' symbols
            and metadata_items' symbols
    Add support for comparing scores that have different number of parts (this previously
        caused a failure). The existing parts are assumed to line up by index (as before,
        score1 part 0 is compared with score2 part 0), and then we generate edits that
        either delete the extra parts in score1, or add the extra parts in score2. The
        number of symbol errors for those edits is simply the notation_size of (the
        number of symbols in) the added or deleted parts.
    Several smallish bugfixes.
