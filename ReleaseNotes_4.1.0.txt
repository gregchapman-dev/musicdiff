Changes since 4.0.0:
    Add new output option that prints JSON containing the symbolic error rate (SER =
        numSymbolErrors / numSymbolsInGroundTruth) to stdout (the JSON actually
        contains all three numbers).  Ground truth is assumed to be the second file.
        If numSymbolsInGroundTruth == 0, SER will be numSymbolErrors, to avoid divide
        by zero.
    Add new API Visualization.get_ser_output() that returns a dict containing the
        symbolic error rate.
    In support of SER, notation_sizes (a.k.a. symbol counts) and diff costs (a.k.a.
        symbolic error counts) have been reviewed and updated:
        AnnNote.notation_size(): add 1 for slash on grace note
        AnnExtra.notation_size(): 1 for the text, add 1 if there is any style specified
        AnnExtra diff error count: text diff costs 1, offset diff costs 1, duration diff
            costs 1, style diff costs 1
        AnnLyric.notation_size(): use len(text) instead of 1;
            add 1 if there's a verse number;
            add 1 if there's a verse identifier (that's different from the number);
            add 1 if styled
        AnnLyric diff cost: text diff costs the Levenshtein distance, verse number diff
            costs 1, verse identifier diff costs 1, offset diff costs 1, style diff
            costs 1
        AnnMeasure.notation_size(): not just notes and extras, add in lyrics
        AnnScore.notation_size(): not just parts, add in staff_groups and metadata_items
    Add support for comparing scores that have different number of parts (this previously
        caused a failure). The existing parts are assumed to line up (as before, score1
        part 0 is compared with score2 part 0), and then we generate an edit that either
        deletes the extra parts in score1, or adds the extra parts in score2.  Cost of
        that edit is simply the notation_size of the added or deleted parts.
    music21 has the concept of a (usually non-printed) time signature that has no meter
        information (m21.meter.SenzaMisuraTimeSignature).  musicdiff now treats that as
        equal to no time signature at all.
