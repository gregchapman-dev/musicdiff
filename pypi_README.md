# musicdiff
A Python3 package (and command-line tool) for computing and visualizing the notation differences between two music scores.

musicdiff is focused on visible notation differences, not only on audible musical differences.  For example, two tied eighth notes are considered different from a single quarter note.  And two beamed 16th notes are considered different from two unbeamed 16th notes. This makes musicdiff particularly useful for assessing the results of Optical Music Recognition software.

musicdiff is derived from: [music-score-diff](https://github.com/fosfrancesco/music-score-diff.git)
    by [Francesco Foscarin](https://github.com/fosfrancesco).

## Setup
Depends on [music21](https://pypi.org/project/music21) (version 8.1+),  [numpy](https://pypi.org/project/numpy), and [converter21](https://pypi.org/project/converter21) (version 2.0+). You also will need to configure music21 (instructions [here](https://web.mit.edu/music21/doc/usersGuide/usersGuide_01_installing.html)) to display a musical score (e.g. with MuseScore).

## Usage
On the command line:

    python3 -m musicdiff file1.musicxml file2.krn

    positional arguments:
      file1       first music score file to compare (any format music21 can parse)
      file2       second music score file to compare (any format music21 can parse)

The musicdiff command line tool will display two rendered score PDFs that have the differences highlighted with color and descriptive text.

musicdiff is also a package, with APIs you can call in your own code. There is a high-level diff() API that the command-line tool uses (that you can tweak the behavior of), and there are also lower level APIs that you can use in projects that perhaps want to do something more complicated than just visualization in PDFs.
